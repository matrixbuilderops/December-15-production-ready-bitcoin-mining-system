# Consensus Mechanism & Ultra Hex Buckets

## Ultra Hex System
- **Scale**: Max 256 Buckets.
- **Bucket Rule**: 1 Bucket = 64 leading hex zeros (1 full SHA256 tier).
- **Consensus**: DTM calculates cross-bucket difficulty. It scales Bucket 1 (68 zeros) correctly so it isn't seen as lower than Bucket 0 (64 zeros).

## DTM GPS Guidance
- **Direction**: DTM aims miners with template difficulty.
- **Rejection**: If solution < Target or in wrong Bucket, DTM rejects.
- **Feedback**: DTM writes EXACT reason to Miner's process folder.
- **Investigation**: Consistent failure triggers a "Miner Investigation" flag in Error Reports.

## Staged Consensus
1. **Miner**: Submits bucket-aware solution.
2. **DTM**: Validates hash vs Bucket vs Bitcoin Network difficulty.
3. **Looping**: Verifies DTM's ledgers and the physical presence of the submission file.
4. **Brain**: Audits hierarchy (Submission Logs, Aggregated reports, Global Index).
5. **Node**: Looping submits after Brain All-Clear.
6. **Final**: Brain re-audits Global Aggregated after broadcast.
