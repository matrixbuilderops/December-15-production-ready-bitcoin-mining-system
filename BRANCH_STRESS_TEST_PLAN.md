# 🔬 BRANCH STRESS TEST & COMPARISON PLAN

**Date:** December 26, 2025
**Goal:** Compare and stress test BOTH branches to create ULTIMATE system

---

## 📊 TEST PLAN

### **Phase 1: File Structure Comparison**
1. Compare file counts
2. Compare folder hierarchies  
3. Check for week folders in both
4. Identify unique files in each branch
5. Compare file sizes

### **Phase 2: Code Comparison**
1. Compare Looping.py (consensus implementation)
2. Compare DTM.py (template management)
3. Compare Brainstem.py (system orchestration)
4. Compare Brain.QTL (validation)
5. Compare production_miner.py

### **Phase 3: Stress Tests - Our Branch**
1. Run subatomic verification
2. Run all 4 modes (demo, test, staging, live)
3. Check week folder creation
4. Verify file counts
5. Test template hot-reload
6. Run for 100 blocks (demo mode)

### **Phase 4: Stress Tests - Three-Layer Branch**
1. Find/run their test suite
2. Run all 4 modes
3. Check consensus validation
4. Test Bitcoin acceptance validation
5. Verify 3-layer validation working
6. Run for 100 blocks (demo mode)

### **Phase 5: Performance Benchmarks**
1. Mining speed (hashes/sec)
2. File I/O performance
3. Memory usage
4. Solution validation speed
5. Template refresh speed

### **Phase 6: Integration Analysis**
1. Identify best features from each
2. Create merge/upgrade plan
3. Document improvements needed
4. Create ultimate system specification
